    "Nome: Juan Felipe Da Silva Rangel\n",

    "O objetivo desta atividade é explorar o dataset 'agaricus_lepiota_small.csv', que representa apenas atributos categóricos. Ela representa um sample de cogumelos, sendo classificados como comestível (edible) ou venenoso (poisonous). Nesta atividade devemos utilizar a validação cruzada em dois níveis para os classifcadores SVM e KNN com intuito primeiramente de analisar ambas acurácias, e também realizar o teste-t, o que resultará na negação ou não da hipótese nula."

Porém se possível preferiria utilizar um classificador melhor do que os que foram desenvolvidos ao longo deste notebook, com o p-value o mais baixo possível."
